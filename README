DESCRIPTION

This is a small and simple package that takes the output of an XML parser
and gives simple methods for accessing the structure of an XML document. It 
is very lightweight, but provides the simplest access to an XML document 
possible. It does not subclass XML::LibXML; rather, it is meant to serve 
purely as an object struct for an outgoing tree. Recently tree manipulation
was also added.

I originally wrote the module as an example of parsing without handlers. This 
was before it used other modules.

REQUIREMENTS

You need XML::LibXML.

Tested on Linux, FreeBSD, and Win32 under perl5.6.0, 5.6.1, 5.8.0, 5.8.4.

INSTALLATION

  perl Makefile.PL
  make 
  make install

Then look at ex.pl. That pretty much sums up the functionality.
